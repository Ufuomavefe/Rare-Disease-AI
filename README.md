# 🧬 AI-Powered Rare Disease Diagnosis

A Streamlit web application that predicts variant pathogenicity using AlphaFold structural data and machine learning.

## Features
- Predicts if genetic variants are pathogenic or benign
- Uses AlphaFold structural confidence scores
- Machine learning model trained on clinical variants
- Real-time 3D structure visualization

## Supported Proteins
- GBA (Gaucher Disease)
- CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis) 
- MECP2 (Rett Syndrome)
- GAA (Pompe Disease)
- HEXA (Tay-Sachs Disease)

## How to Use
1. Select a protein from the dropdown
2. Enter a mutation (e.g., L444P, p.Leu444Pro)
3. View AI prediction with confidence score
4. See structural analysis and 3D structure links

## Dissertation Project
This app was developed as part of a dissertation on "AI-Powered Health App for Rare Disease Diagnosis Using AlphaFold Predictions"
